# hello-world
First ever repository on Github !!
Hi world,
My name is Tobi. I am a new programmer and looking to learn! The ability to create is what drew me to Github and I look forward to being able to create more. I am hoping to look back on these initial readme files with seasoned bemusement. Onward and upward!
